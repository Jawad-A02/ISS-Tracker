# ISS-Tracker
Designed and developed a full-stack MERN application that enables users to manage their exercise routines. 
The app provides the ability to add, delete, edit, and view exercises.
Implemented the user interface using React and Bootstrap, creating a clean and intuitive layout that simplifies the exercise management process.
Integrated a MongoDB database to store exercise data and used Mongoose to define the data schema and interact with the database.
Implemented a RESTful API using Express.js to handle user requests, and created routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting exercises.
Conducted thorough testing of the application to ensure functionality and minimize errors.
