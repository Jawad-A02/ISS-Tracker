# ISS-Tracker
Developed a JavaScript code that utilizes the Open Notify API to obtain the current location of the International Space Station (ISS) and the user's location.
Integrated the Leaflet JavaScript library to display a map on the user interface, allowing the user to see the location of the ISS in real-time.
Utilized the haversine formula to calculate the distance between the ISS and the user's location, displaying the distance in kilometers or miles on the user interface.
Implemented a timer that updates the location of the ISS on the map every 2 seconds, providing the user with a real-time view of the satellite's movement.
Utilized error handling to ensure that the application runs smoothly even if the API data is not available or if the user's location cannot be obtained.
Tested the code thoroughly to ensure that the application is accurate, reliable, and user-friendly.
Documented the code effectively, using clear and concise comments to help other developers understand the functionality of the application.
